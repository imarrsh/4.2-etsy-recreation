# Etsy Recreation
#### (4.2.etsy-recreation)

This project is from the middle of week 4 at [The Iron Yard Greenville](https://theironyard.com). The learning goal was explore the use of Handlebars templates using script tags of the type `text/x-handlebars-template` to create a dynamic product listing using real data from Etsy's API. 

The template tags are targeted with the help of jQuery, and both the taxonomy paths and product list are generated. The search function is live, so go ahead and try to search for something!
